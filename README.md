**Junction 2020 Connected**

## The project in a nutshelll :peanuts:
We tried to create a voicerecognition app, which suggests nearby restaurants to the user, using the **JAICF-framework**. The user can ask the app, which kind of food he/she wants, 
and the app responds accordingly. For example, you can ask "I would like some chinese food", and the app searches for the nearby chinese restaurants.
For this, our app uses google places search. The http query string has a keyword, which in the case of the last example would be "chinese".
